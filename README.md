MLN + OpenStack Havana + Ubuntu 12.04
===

This MLN repository is particularly aimed at using MLN as root on an Ubuntu
12.04 system, managing instances on OpenStack Havana or Amazon EC2.

MLN will run fine on other systems, however the nova packages
installed belong to the Havan release. Make sure you install the
appropirate nova command-line tools for your OpenStack version.
